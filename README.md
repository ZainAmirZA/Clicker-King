all in one go. Its basically the Bowflex for your wrist. So change your life TODAY by playing **CLICKER KING**

Clicker King is a simple aiming and clicking game where youre given a 3x3 board as a playing field where a dot can showup at any moment once you press the start button. From there, you 
will have 30-seconds to aim and click the target as many times as you can before the timer runs out. Once complete, you can see where your current speed stands and work towards a better
score on your next replay! 

### Getting Started

- The timer will be set to 30, begin its countdown and begin to show targets on the board which the player needs to click before they dissapear 
- At the end of the 30-seconds the player will recieve their score and some feedback regarding their performance. 
- ENJOY!
